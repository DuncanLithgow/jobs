Telicent is hiring a front-end engineer to help implement our groundbreaking open source data transformation platform and web apps.

Our all-new secure platform enables customers to extricate themselves from architectural patterns that stifle change. We do this by unlocking data and creating frictionless integration for next generation applications. This solves significant interoperability issues for organisations with complex data needs, creating freedom for adaptability, innovation, new integrations and progress, underpinned by data governance.

To compliment the platform's rich functionality, and to accelerate customer engagement and innovation, we're building all-new platform-native web apps around data management and data visualisation. These highly visual and interactive apps will join a no/low code app ecosystem where third party apps can leverage the platform.

We're ready for a further front-end colleague to join us. We're pre-beta and so it's great timing for you to make a positive impact as we capture and implement ways users can interact with our platform and apps, releasing capabilities in data previously impossible.

You'll be encouraged to explore responsibilities, to grow, and to maintain a healthy curiosity for front-end tech and for finding better ways of working with software.

Upcoming projects: 

Prototyping, MVP and implementation of all-new web apps that manage, represent and visualise data (you'll be supported on design and UX aspects) - e.g. utilising D3, Cytoscape, Plotly
Breaking new ground in the visualisation of graph data, allowing complex graphs to be displayed and manipulated more creatively and intuitively 
Collaborating with back-end colleagues, to implement the platform's tools, consoles and dashboards
Establishing best practises for user interaction and feedback, and ensuring consistent implementation across the apps
Identifying improvements to the front-end architecture to promote and facilitate reuse and consistency
Automating front-end testing
Supporting dialogue with customers, working directly with end users
Helping establish our engineering culture, our methods and tooling
 
We're looking for:

Someone ready to contribute to architectural, engineering and layout discussions, implementing effective solutions that empower users to achieve what they need  
Strong front-end coding skills, applied to high quality software products
Ability to mentor less-experienced colleagues on front-end good practice and self-improvement
User empathy, and an appreciation of ergonomics for beautiful and useful applications
Ability to unpack complex requirements, to uphold security of sensitive data and to conform to best practises
A collaborative, adaptable, user-centred approach
A strong understanding of software engineering principles and technology agnostic, 
A depth of ability with JavaScript, and good familiarity with React - we're open to you transferring from another framework, such as Vue or Svelte
Good familiarity with GraphQL and REST - could implement an API

Current ecosystem - we'll welcome your influence:

JavaScript | React calling Python, Node, Java, Go | Cytoscape, D3, Plotly | GraphQL | Github Actions | lightweight Kanban

Salary and benefits:

£60,000 - £90,000+ we're keeping an open mind
EMI share scheme
28 days holiday + bank holidays + can carry over 13 days
A company that values work-life balance, personal development and sustainable workloads

Optional part-time working, let us know what you need

From smarter cities and infrastructure transformation to initiatives modelling the consequences of climate change. From defence technology accelerators to contributing to the latest Open Data standards, we're at the forefront of the innovation landscape and our products are helping customers reimagine how they operate, perform and realise their ambitions. 

It's an opportunity to become a formative team member of an enterprise-grade platform core team, where you'll have a voice and be listened to, and where you can enjoy healthy amounts of support, progression and autonomy in your work across large aspects of our code base. You'll find us open, honest and supportive, keen to help you succeed in your new role. https://www.telicent.io/
